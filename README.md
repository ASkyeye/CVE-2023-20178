# CVE-2023-20178

This is PoC for Arbitrary File Delete vulnerability in Cisco Secure Client (tested on 5.0.01242) and Cisco AnyConnect  (tested on 4.10.06079).

When a user connect to vpn, vpndownloader.exe process is started in background and it will create directory in c:\windows\temp with default permissions in following format:
<random numbers>.tmp 
After creating this directory vpndownloader.exe will check if that directory is empty and if its not it will delete all files/directories in there.
This behaviour can be abused to perform arbitrary file delete as NT Authority\SYSTEM account.
